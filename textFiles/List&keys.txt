   ---------------------- List & Keys In ReactJS -----------------------

1. Creating A HTML list In React.

2. We can Use JSX To Done the List

3.In list When we need to change the state we need to mention the  key attribute in JSX
  because we need to control the state via the key in list.

4. When change the property of the object we call whole object using 
   {....objectName , property} --> this call the whole object and change the 
   specified property in the object.
